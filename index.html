  <p> 
    The first season of Michigan Basketball occurred in 1909 who achieved a 1-4 record. 
    The program was then shut down due to low attendance but it returned in 1917 in what was 
    considered the inaugural season of varsity basketball. The basketball program has had a total 
    of 17 head coaches lead the program, with Steve Fisher winning the lone National Championship in 1989.
