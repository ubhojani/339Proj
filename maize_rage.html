      <p>
        The Maize Rage is the student cheering section for the University of Michigan Men’s
        Basketball team. The Maize Rage emphasizes spirit and sportsmanship in its support
        of Men’s Basketball. Our 2000+ members strive to provide a vocal presence at Crisler Arena,
        as well as to promote the University of Michigan Basketball Wolverine program across campus
        and beyond.

      <h3>Membership</h3>
      <img src = "imgs/MR 2.jpg" alt = "Maize Rage 2">
      <p>
        All student section season ticket holders are official members of the Maize Rage.
        There are no mandatory requirements, fees, or dues associated with membership of
        the Maize Rage. Members who wish to have a greater involvement in the Maize Rage
        are invited to join the Maize Rage Core, a smaller group of students who have a
        greater hand in the formation, planning, and operations of the Maize Rage.
